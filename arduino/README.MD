# Arduino classworks

##### Button.ino:
Make the LED blink faster, get LEDs to blink alternately 

##### TMP36_Button.ino:
Use the TMP36 component to: 
- Get temperature based on TMP36 read
- Print result on serial console 
- With flat side of TMP36 facing you, left pin should receive voltage, right pin should be grounded, middle pin sends data

##### WiFi_connect.ino:
Have NodeMCU connect to wireless router. After connecting, prints out the NodeMCU’s IP address 

##### WiFi_dweet.ino:
Decide if the node MCU will be a:
- Client - which sends requests to servers and processes response(s)
- Server - which waits for clients to send it data (and responds accordingly)

Have NodeMCU connect to wireless router. After connecting, prints out the NodeMCU’s IP address 
Then connects to dweet.io and reads latest dweet then shows dweet on Serial Monitor.

##### WiFi_webserver.ino:

##### WiFi_webserver_button.ino:

##### servo.ino:

##### LDR_Analog.ino:
